JavaScript is a dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative styles. 

There are a few primary ways to assign values to names in JavaScript - using variables or constants. Variables are always written in camelCase; constants are written in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE. 

variables in JavaScript can be defined using the ``const`` ,``let``, or ``var`` keyboard. 

___variables___
```js
let myFirstVariable = 1;
myFirstVariable = 'Some String';
myFirstVariable = new SomeComplexClass();
```
___const___ 
```js
const MY_FIRST_CONSTANT = 10;
```
