# Overview 
## What is react native?
React Native is a cross-platform mobile development framework that lets you build apps for iOS, Android, and web, using JavaScript (mostly with React.js principles) while maintaining a single source code. Its core concepts differ from Go/Python/Bashâ€”they're based on JavaScript's component model, state management, and often leverage JSX syntax.

#MindsetShift
- No css or special language for UI, it's done using pure JavaScript/react for styling. 
- The style names and values match css but are in js flavor. 
    - everything is defined in camel-case 
    - uses flexbox for layout 
    - Each component can have its own corresponding stylesheet. 
- React native provides platform-specific styling available for IOS and Android. (_maybe a warapper_)
