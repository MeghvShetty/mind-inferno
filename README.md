> A chaotic forge of curiosity — where I melt down ideas, experiment with code, and let new skills take shape.

Welcome to Mind Inferno — my chaotic forge for all things programming. This is where I learn, break, fix, and experiment with a melting pot of languages, frameworks, and ideas. If it compiles, runs, or crashes spectacularly, it’s fair game to land here. Mind Inferno is my personal code laboratory — a place to tinker, explore, and push buttons just to see what happens. Some things work, some things fail gloriously — but every line teaches me something new.

# 🌋 Why “Mind Inferno”?
Because learning code is like stoking a fire —
You feed it with curiosity,
You endure the heat of debugging,
And in the flames, your skills are forged.

# 🧪 What to Expect
No polished projects — this is learning-in-progress.
Small, self-contained experiments — exploring syntax, features, APIs, and patterns.
Multiple languages & frameworks in one place — a melting pot of tech.
Messy but meaningful — comments, TODOs, and half-baked ideas included.

# 🎯 Purpose
1. Learn by doing — code to understand, not just read (_every commit is something I’ve built or tested myself_).
2. Track progress — so I can revisit how I solved something. A living notebook of my journey.
3. Compare technologies — see how the same idea plays out in different stacks.
4. Have fun — because breaking code teaches as much as fixing it.

# ⚠️ Disclaimer
This repo isn’t production-ready.
It’s raw, experimental, and sometimes intentionally broken — because that’s how I learn.
